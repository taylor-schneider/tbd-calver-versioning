# This script will determine the version number of a commit based on the 
# Trunk Based Development branching strategy and a CalVer versioning strategy
#
# The branching strategy assumes that the following branches/branch types exist:
#
#   release/<yyyy.mm.dd>
#   patch/<human-friendly-description>
#   master
#   bug/<human-friendly-description>
#   feature/<human-friendly-description>
#
# We can expect version numbers to resemble the following:
#
#   2022.03.31.release.5
#   2022.03.31.patch.2a00f14b
#   2022.03.31.main.1
#   2022.03.31.feature.2a00f143
#   2022.03.31.bug.2a00f143028f
#
# The build number or SHA will be added based on the branch type. Build numbers 
# will increment with each merge that occurs on a given day.
#
